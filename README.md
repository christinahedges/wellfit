# WellFit

Transit modeling with [`starry`](https://rodluger.github.io/starry/) and [`celerite`](https://celerite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), capitalizing on gradients. Under development.

### notebooks

This folder contains a few notebooks about fitting different transit models that we've collected over the year. They are there for inspiration and for basic examples. They will be deleted before the stable release of wellfit.
